# Hangman
Multiplayer Hangman!

Hi there!
I used what I learned in my CS201 (Principles of Software Development) and made a multiplayer hangman game. 
The players all have to be on the same computer, though.
The program is run in the console. I used Eclipse as my IDE. If you also have Eclipse, here's how to run the game:

1) Import the project.
2) Run ServerMain.java; this will start up the server that each player connects to.
3) When prompted, type in config.txt. This is the text file that's provided, and it sets up the configuration of the server.
4) Run ClientMain.java; this will create the actual player (AKA YOU!)
5) Again, type in config.txt and you should be automatically connected to the server.
6) Type in your name, and choose if you want to start a game or join one (there are no games unless you start one).
7) If you want to play by yourself, the game will start automatically. 
Otherwise, the game supports up to 4 people. 
The game won't start until all players join.
8) For each player needed, you run ClientMain.java. The game won't start until all players join!

There's also a video demo'ing me running the game with 2 players.

Enjoy!
